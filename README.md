Project Title: E-commerce📊

Overview:💡

The goal of this project is to analyze sales data from the O-list platform to help stakeholders make better business decisions. This involves visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs), uncovering trends, and finding through dashboards. To fulfill these goals we worked on different skills like Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and SQL.

KPI To Solve:

1)Weekday Vs Weekend (order_purchase_timestamp) Payment Statistics

2)Number of Orders with review score 5 and payment type as credit card.

3)Average number of days taken for order_delivered_customer_date for pet_shop

4)Average price and payment values from customers of sao paulo city

5)Relationship between shipping days (order_delivered_customer_date - order_purchase_timestamp) Vs review scores.

• Unique Customers: 96K

• Total Profit: 3.25M

• Freight Value: 2.06M

• Avg Review Score: 4.09

• Total Seller city: 3.094K

📈Insights from the Dashboards:📊

   Weekend Sales: 23% (22.19K)



2)Number of Orders with review score 5 and Payment type is Credit 
    card:


🔹More orders have been placed via Credit Card Payment than 
     boleto, voucher & debit card.


3)Average price & payment values from customers of Sao Paulo 
   city.  

🔹Avg payment value (135) is higher than the avg price (111). 
    Additional charges related to logistics.


4)Average number of days taken for Pet shop:

🔹For the pet shop category, the avg number of days taken to 
    order for Pet Shop is 11 days, which is very high & likely an 
    anomaly or an incorrect calculation. such a high value would 
   suggest an extreme delay in delivery times.

5)Relationship between Shipping days vs Review scores:

 🔹Shipping days 21 taken review score 5 & 20 shipping days taken 
     for review score 1.
